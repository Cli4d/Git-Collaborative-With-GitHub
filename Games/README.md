# About The Practice games

In this directory you'll find 2 markdown files and another directory called `Submission`. 
1. **Markdown Files**   
The 2 markdown files are instructions for the games.   

1. **`Submission` Directory**   
In the `Submission` directory there are 2 markdown files for the meme game and the vision board challenge. These are template files. You can modify the template for your submission or you can just delete it's contents to create your own. Whichever works for you.

Since the games are purely based on GitHub Flavoured markdown syntax, those unfamiliar to markdown syntax are advised to do the [Introduction to Markdown module](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown) on GitHub skills first.

## Get Started
Start off by reading the game instructions in [gitGiggling.md](gitGiggling.md) and [GoL-Vision-Board.md](GoL-Vision-Board.md) then start!
